### ðŸ¤” What is this about?
A community effort to help with the devops talent shortage, share knowledge, and meet interesting people. This is a **free** hands on bootcamp -you will be learning by doing-. The bootcamp should take about **20 hours/week** for **2 months** to complete all milestones -so you don't have to quit your day job-.

The bootcamp is remote and asyncrhonous, our main means of communication will be the DevopZilla Community Slack channel. We can meetup between milestones just to get to know each other better, but this is optional.

You are going to tackle milestones alone, refer to reference links, and ask other people to help you out on slack. You should also try helping others once in a while ðŸ˜…! without sharing final deliverables off-course, because this will not help anyone learn!!

N.B. Private slack channels for each milestone will only be unlocked when you pass the previous milestone acceptance criteria and submit the deliverables.

### ðŸ¤“ What am I going to learn?
1) **Building a simple RESTful API to perform CRUD operations**
2) **Deploying web applications on cloud VM instances**
3) **Dockerizing web applications and deploying them using docker-compose**
4) **How to perform load testing**
5) **Bulding continous integration and continous deployment pipelines**
6) **Learning about horizontal vs verticial scalability and load balancing**
7) **Very brief intro to Kubernetes**
