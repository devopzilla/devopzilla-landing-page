## GOAL
Handle higher traffic loads by scalling the app hosizontally. To achieve horizontal scalability the app will be deployed across multiple EC2 instances.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
+ Create two EC2 machines and deploy two instances of the app on them.
+ Create once EC2 machine for the load balancer (NGINX as a reverse proxy in our case). NGINX instance should be dockerized.
+ Create once EC2 machine for the database. Database instance should be dockerized.
+ Configure the load balancer to route traffic to the two instances in a round robin fashion.
+ Update your CI/CD to deploy the instances on different machines.

## DELIVERABLES ðŸ“¦
+ Github project link (the project should be public)
+ Docker Hub repository link (the repo should be public)
+ Public server IP v4 address
+ Short demo video posted on Slack
    + show how the app is deployed
    + explain the app architecture
    + explain how the CI/CD pipeline changed
    + explain the server load balancing mechanism
    + show load testing run
+ Load testing reports in text files on the repo, inside the dir "load_test_reports/load_test_{milestone number}"
