      content: '"I have had a very good experience dealing with Devopzilla. They have helped, worked with, and advised our team in many aspects regarding our application and our infrastructure. Devopzilla has come into a time to fill a huge gap that we had, work on our infrastructure and carefully moving us into a much more reliable and scalable one. They have worked side by side with our tech team to achieve these successes and we think it would have been 10 times difficult to do it without them."'
